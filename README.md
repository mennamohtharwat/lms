# Learning Management System (LMS) Project

## Introduction 🎓

This Learning Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive Java application designed to facilitate online education by managing courses, lessons, assignments, and users. The project provides a scalable platform where instructors can create and manage courses, while students can subscribe to courses and submit assignments.

The system is built with a focus on clean architecture principles, separating concerns into domain models and services to ensure maintainability and extensibility. This modular approach allows for easy addition of new features and scaling of existing ones as educational needs evolve.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized using a feature-module and domain-module approach to ensure clean scalability. This architecture separates the concerns of different domains while allowing for integration where needed.

## Features ✨

- **User Management**: Support for different user roles (Students, Instructors) with appropriate permissions
- **Course Creation**: Instructors can create and manage courses
- **Lesson Management**: Courses can be organized into lessons for structured learning
- **Assignment Handling**: Creation, submission, and tracking of assignments
- **Course Subscriptions**: Students can subscribe to courses and track their progress

## Patterns 🧩

The project implements several design patterns to ensure clean architecture and code maintainability:

- **Service Pattern**: Business logic is encapsulated within service classes that provide a clean API for operations
- **Polymorphism**: User models use inheritance to share common attributes while specializing behavior
- **Domain-Driven Design**: The codebase is organized around business domains (Courses, Users) rather than technical concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access and persistence (implicit in services implementation)
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected where needed to promote loose coupling

## Dependencies 📦

- **Java Version**: Java SDK 23
- **Development Environment**: Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your Java IDE
3. Compile and run the Main.java file

## Extending the System 🔧

To add new features to the LMS:

1. Create new model classes in the appropriate domain folder (e.g., Models/Courses)
2. Implement or extend service classes to handle business logic for the new models
3. Update the Main.java file or create a dedicated controller/UI to expose the new functionality
